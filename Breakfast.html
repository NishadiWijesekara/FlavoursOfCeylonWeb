		<p>Sri Lankan pol roti is a delicious flatbread made with coconut and flour. Here's a simple recipe for you.</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated coconut (you can use desiccated coconut if fresh is not available)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Water, as needed</li>
            <li>Coconut oil or vegetable oil for cooking</li>
	 </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, grated coconut, chopped onion, green chilies, coriander leaves, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft dough. The dough should be pliable but not too sticky. Add more flour if it's too wet or a little more water if it's too dry.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, roughly the size of a lime.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with coconut oil or vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Take one dough ball and flatten it on a clean, flat surface using your palm or a rolling pin. Try to make it as thin as possible without breaking it.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the flattened dough onto the hot skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on one side until it starts to brown slightly.</li>
			<li>Flip the roti and cook the other side for another 2-3 minutes until it's cooked through and lightly browned.</li>
			<li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.</li>
			<li>Once cooked, remove the rotis from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.</li>
			<li>Serve hot with your favorite curry, chutney, or even a simple dal.</li>
			<li>Enjoy your delicious Sri Lankan pol roti!</li>

        <h2>2.Hoppers (Appam)</h2>

		</div>
		<p>Sri Lankan hoppers, also known as appam, are a popular and versatile dish in Sri Lankan cuisine.
		They are bowl-shaped, fermented pancakes made from a batter of rice flour, coconut milk, water, yeast, and a pinch of salt. The batter is left to ferment, giving the hoppers a subtle tangy flavor and a slightly spongy texture. 
		Hoppers are typically cooked in a special pan called an appachatti or hopper pan, which gives them their distinctive shape â€“ thin and crispy around the edges with a soft, fluffy center. 
		They can be enjoyed plain or with various toppings such as eggs, onion sambol, coconut sambol, or curries, making them suitable for breakfast, snacks, or even as part of a main meal. 
		Sri Lankan hoppers are cherished for their unique taste and texture, reflecting the rich culinary heritage of the island nation.</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup rice flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Coconut oil or cooking spray for greasing the pan</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: eggs, onion sambol, coconut sambol, curry, etc.</li>
			
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, coconut milk, salt, and the yeast mixture. Mix well until you have a smooth batter. The batter should be slightly thicker than pancake batter. If it's too thick, add a bit more water.</li>
            <li>Cover the batter and let it ferment in a warm place for at least 2 hours, or overnight if possible. This fermentation process adds flavor to the hoppers.</li>
            <li>After the batter has fermented, give it a good stir. If it's too thick, you can add a little more water to reach the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Heat a hopper pan or a small non-stick frying pan over medium heat. If you don't have a hopper pan, you can use a small frying pan and cover it with a lid.</li>
            <li>Grease the pan lightly with coconut oil or cooking spray. Pour a ladleful of the batter into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan around to spread the batter thinly and evenly, making sure the edges are slightly thicker than the center.</li>
			<li>Cover the pan with a lid and let the hopper cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden brown and crispy, and the center is set.</li>
            <li>If you're making egg hoppers, crack an egg into the center of the hopper and cover the pan again. Let it cook for another 1-2 minutes until the egg is cooked to your liking.</li>
            <li>Once the hopper is cooked, gently slide it out of the pan onto a plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the hoppers warm with your favorite toppings such as onion sambol, coconut sambol, curry, or any other accompaniments you prefer.</li>
			<li>Enjoy your homemade Sri Lankan hoppers!</li>
